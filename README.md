# Mastering Docker


## What is going to happen

It is a practical session where we will practice the fine arts of Dockerfile creation, image building, and container running.

Please install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/install/)/[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) before attending the event,
and pull some images using the following commands:

```bash
docker pull golang:1.13
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/aspnet:3.1
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:3.1
docker pull mongo
docker pull mongo-express
```

## When and where

The Meetup is scheduled for the 20th of January 2020 in Rome at [LUISS EnLabs](https://www.luissenlabs.com/), Termini station.
