# A more complex image

The new image will print a file content to `stdout`

1. For commodity create a new directory for the project named `static-printer`

1. Create a file named `data.txt` into the directory with the following command:

```bash
echo "That is dummy data written to a data file" > data.txt
```

1. Create a `Dockerfile` in the same folder.
   The docker image must rely on the `bash` image and use the `/printer` working directory.
   In this directory must be copied the `data.txt` file.
   Finally the container will use the `cat` program to read the `data.txt` file.

```dockerfile
FROM bash
WORKDIR /printer
COPY data.txt data.txt
CMD ["cat", "data.txt"]
```

1. Build and run the image 

```bash
docker build -t ex3 .
docker run --rm ex3
```

1. Finally cleanup deleting the image

```bash
docker rmi ex3
```
