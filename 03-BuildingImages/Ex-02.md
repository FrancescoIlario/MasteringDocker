# My first Docker image

Let's create our first Docker image.
As usual lets create an `Hello World!` one.

1. Create a new `Dockerfile`: it is a simple text file named `Dockerfile`.

1. Each image is built upon another image. To specify which is the ancestor use the `FROM` keyword.

```dockerfile
FROM bash
```

1. Now we have to run the `echo` program and print `Hello World!`.
   This is the main process of the container, for this reason we will use the `CMD` keyword.

```dockerfile
FROM bash
CMD ["echo", "Hello World!"]
```

1. Open a shell in the directory containing the Dockerfile

1. Build the image using the `build` command

```
docker build -t mfhw:latest .
```

1. Run the image

```
docker run --rm mfhw:latest
```

1. Finally cleanup deleting the image

```bash
docker rmi mfhw:latest
```
