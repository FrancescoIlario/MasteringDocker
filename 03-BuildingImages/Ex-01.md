# Fun with images

## List all the images

List all the images with the following command

```
docker ls
```

The `hello-world` image should be present.


## Add a new tag to the hello-world image

Add the tag `mc-hw:1.0` to the `hello-world` image by using the following command

```
docker tag hello-world mc-hw:1.0
```

We can now display all the tags of the hello-world image by using the following command

```
docker image ls | grep $(docker image ls --format "{{.ID}}" hello-world)
```

Now try use the `image ls` command passing filtering by `hello-world` or `mc-hw`.

```
docker image ls hello-world
docker image ls mc-hw
```

## Remove a tag from an image / Delete the image

Use the `image remove` command to untag an image.
Aliases for this command are `rmi` and `image rm`.

```
docker rmi mc-hw:1.0
Untagged: mc-hw:1.0
```

It is also possible to remove an image by `id` and this will delete all the tags.
If the image has more than one tag, an error will be displayed suggesting you to `force` the operation if you are sure.

To replicate the scenario, add a the tag `mc-hw:latest` to the `hello-world:latest` image and then try to delete it by id.
Finally try to force the operation using the `-f` parameter.

```
docker tag hello-world:latest mc-hw:latest
IMAGE_ID=$(docker image ls --format "{{.ID}}" hello-world:latest)
docker rmi ${IMAGE_ID}
docker rmi -f ${IMAGE_ID}
```
As final result all the tags should be removed and the image deleted.

```
