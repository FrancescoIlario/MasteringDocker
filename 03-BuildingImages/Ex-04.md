# A multi-stage image

It is possible to use multiple `FROM` statements in a single dockerfile, defining in this way different stages.

For example it is possible to specify a stage used to build the binaries and the stage used to run it.

Let's create a simple `Go` hello-world example.

1. Create a project directory named `go-hello-world`.
1. Open a shell into the `go-hello-world` directory.
1. Create a new `main.go` file with the following content:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello World in Go!")
}
```

1. Create a Dockerfile with the following content

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.13 as build
WORKDIR /hw
COPY main.go main.go
RUN CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -o hw main.go 

FROM alpine:latest as prod 
RUN apk add ca-certificates
COPY --from=build /hw/hw /usr/bin/hw
CMD ["hw"]
```

1. Build and run the image:

```
docker build -t ex04 .
docker run --rm ex04
```

1. Cleanup the image

```
docker rmi ex04
```
