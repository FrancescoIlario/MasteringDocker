# Running multiple containers

1. For commodity create a new directory for the project named `mongompose` and use this folder as Current Working Directory

1. Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file and start editing it

1. First of all add the compose version header (version 3 is sufficient):

```yaml
version: "3"
```

1. Declare the services. We will add an instance of MongoDB and a web client for MongoDB

```yaml
services:
    mdb:                                    # service name
        image: "mongo:latest"
    mdb-exp:
        image: "mongo-express:latest"
        environment:                        
            ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER: mdb   # the name of the mongodb container
        ports:
            - "8081:8081"                   # published port: the service will be available on http://localhost:8081
```

1. Validate the configuration file and then apply it with `docker-compose up`

```bash
docker-compose config -q
if [ $? -eq 0 ]
then
    docker-compose up
fi
```
1. Navigate to http://localhost:8081 to see the Mongo-Express web page and play with Mongo

1. Attach a disk volume where to persist the MongoDB data. 

```diff
+ 5     volumes:
+ 6     - mongo_data:/data/db

+ 15    volumes:
+ 16        mongo_data:
```

1. Apply the configuration file with detached mode to maintain an active shell and execute the docker-compose in background.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

1. A new volume will be created and mounted into the service `mdb`. Create a new database named `i_will_persist`.

1. Use `docker ps` to inspect the active containers. The result should be similar to the following:

```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                  COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES
bfe911b1d39c        mongo-express:latest   "tini -- /docker-ent…"   36 seconds ago      Up 34 seconds       0.0.0.0:8081->8081/tcp   mongompose_mdb-exp_1
a62801719461        mongo:latest           "docker-entrypoint.s…"   36 seconds ago      Up 34 seconds       27017/tcp                mongompose_mdb_1
```

1. Stop the environment with

```bash
docker-compose stop
```

1. Use `docker ps` to inspect the active containers. The result should be similar to the following:

```
IMAGE                  CREATED             STATUS                  PORTS                    NAMES
```

1. Clean up the environment with:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

The result should be similar to:

```
➜ docker-compose down
Removing mongompose_mdb_1     ... done
Removing mongompose_mdb-exp_1 ... done
Removing network mongompose_default
```

1. As you can see the it did not deleted the volume as default. Look for the volume using the following command

```bash
docker volume ls | grep mongo_data
```

You should have as result 

```
local               mongompose_mongo_data
```

1. Create again the environment using `docker-compose up -d` and refresh the page at [http://localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081).
   The database `i_will_persist` will be there waiting for you.

1. To dispose also the volume use the `-v | --volumes` flag of the `down` command.

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

Result:

```
Stopping mongompose_mdb_1     ... done
Stopping mongompose_mdb-exp_1 ... done
Removing mongompose_mdb_1     ... done
Removing mongompose_mdb-exp_1 ... done
Removing network mongompose_default
Removing volume mongompose_mongo_data
```
