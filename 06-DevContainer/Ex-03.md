# Complex devcontainer with Docker Compose

In this Exercise we will add some services to the previous environment, so complete the previous exercise if you did not.

## Add MongoDB and Mongo-Express services

1. Modify the `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml` file as follow

```diff
+ 40    networks:
+ 41        mdb_net:
```
    
```diff
+ 46     mdb:
+ 47       volumes:
+ 48         - mdb_vol:/data/db
+ 49       networks:
+ 50         - mdb_net
+ 51       image: "mongo:latest"
+ 52     mdb-exp:
+ 53       networks:
+ 54         mdb_net:
+ 55       ports:
+ 56         - "8081:8081"
+ 57       image: "mongo-express:latest"
+ 58       environment:
+ 59         ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER: mdb
+ 60
+ 61  volumes:
+ 62    mdb_vol:
+ 63
+ 64  networks:
+ 65    mdb_net: 
```

1. Press `F1` (or Ctrl+Shift+P) and look for `> Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container`

1. Wait for the process to complete, it will require an active internet connection

1. Now open a shell and list the running container

    ```
    docker ps
    ```

    The result will be similar to the following:

    ```
    IMAGE                                 PORTS                    NAMES
    go-compose-complex_devcontainer_dev   0.0.0.0:4480->80/tcp     go-compose-complex_devcontainer_dev_1
    mongo-express:latest                  0.0.0.0:8081->8081/tcp   go-compose-complex_devcontainer_mdb-exp_1
    mongo:latest                          27017/tcp                go-compose-complex_devcontainer_mdb_1
    ```

    As we can see the containers declared in the docker-compose file are now created and running.

    Let connect to the Mongo Express service navigating to http://localhost:8081
